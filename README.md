Breast Cancer Diagnosis Prediction
Problem Statement
Breast cancer is a prevalent form of cancer among women globally, with early detection being crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Medical imaging techniques, such as mammography, provide valuable information for diagnosing breast cancer. However, interpreting these images accurately can be challenging and time-consuming for healthcare professionals. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can assist in diagnosing breast cancer as malignant or benign based on features extracted from medical images.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a robust machine learning model capable of accurately classifying breast tumors as malignant or benign. Specific objectives include:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and understand the distribution of features.
1. Feature Selection and Engineering: Identify relevant features for breast cancer prediction using statistical analysis and domain knowledge. Perform feature selection and engineering techniques to enhance the predictive model's performance, such as feature scaling or dimensionality reduction.
2. Machine Learning Model (SVM): Implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for binary classification of breast tumors. Tune hyperparameters and optimize the SVM model to achieve the best performance.
3. Evaluation: Train the SVM model on a portion of the dataset and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Approach

Evaluation:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the SVM model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set using appropriate evaluation metrics.
Analyze the model's performance and provide insights and recommendations for diagnosing breast cancer.
